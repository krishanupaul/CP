# Bit Manipulation Functions

There are some built-in bit manipulation functions in gcc complier that you should be awared of before starting CP. 

* **\_builtin\_popcount()** - It returns the number of set bits in the number.
* **\_builtin\_parity()** - It is used to check the parity of a number. It returns true if the number has odd parity else it returns false for even parity.
* **__builtin_clz()** - This is very important fucntion which is used to count the number of leading 0s in the number.
* **__builtin_ctz()** - This is used to count the number of trailing 0s.
