# Next Permuation

* Instead of applying the logic for next Permutation, there is a funtion that is present in the C++ standard library which is called as next_permutation.
* It returns true or false based on the condition if next pemutation of the string is possible or not. If it is possible it will change the content of the array or string which is passed in it.
* It gives the next permutation of the present array as if it is present in the dictionary.
* This is basically applied on the strings but it can be applied on the arrays also.
* It is a waste for applying it on an array with 2 digit number.
